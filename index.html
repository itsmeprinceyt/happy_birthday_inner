                Hey there, 😳 <br><br>
    It has been a while, hasn't it? I put together all of this from scratch just for you to express how much I ❤️ you!! <br><br>
    You mean everything to me, and I aspire to make each day special 🫶. Not just today but every day! Because if every day is filled with joy, we could celebrate birthdays daily! 😳😳😊 I know you're not a fan of birthdays and all, but come on, it's alright, bae! <br><br>
    I consider myself fortunate and happy to know you, even your pokish, double-chinned moments! 🤡😭🥸 <br><br>
    I truly love you! Nobody is perfect, neither you nor I, nor anything in this galaxy... 💫but we still find reasons to cherish it. We gaze at broken galaxies or a distant star fading away and find beauty in those moments⭐💫, thinking they're the most beautiful we've ever seen. People also wish for what they want to come true.💫 So why the hell I can't do that? You're my Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Pro max ❤️😳😭 and my Milky Way 🌝 Yummy Yummy Milky Way!
    <br><br>
    I just want to say that I love you and please don't ever leave me, we'll sit in the silence when we have nothing to say and even hold hands, we'll get over anything that life throws at us so please don't give up on me because I will not! on YOU! ❤️🌟 <br><br>I love you, Happy Birthday Poki 🎂🍰🥳🎈🎊🎉💖
